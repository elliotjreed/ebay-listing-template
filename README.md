# eBay Listing Template

This repository contains the source code for Elliot J. Reed's simple eBay listing template. It's all HTML with a bit of Schema.org markup to provide some additional product metadata.

Feel free to edit and use anything you like. As always, I am available for hire with any additional web or design work, or consultancy for eBay and other ecommerce platforms.

## Modifying the template

You'll want to change `YOUR-EBAY-USER-ID` to your own eBay username / store name as that will direct the viewer to your contact form provided by eBay.

Also you'll probably want to change `PRODUCT` to your listing title, `DESCRIPTION` to your own description, and `YOUR NAME` to either your personal name or registered company name.
